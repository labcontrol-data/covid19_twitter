About
============

This repository provides data that complement [the public data available in this repository (click here), which is updated almost daily by Dr. Juan M. Banda from the Georgia State University and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). Note that [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) collected all the Twitter posts containing words related to the Covid-19 pandemics. Their database contains more than one billion posts, and [it is freely available here.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter)

[To explore this database](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter), some knowledge of Python and its libraries is necessary. 
[The repository maintained by Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter)  presents a daily list containing the top 1000 most common words in the Twitter posts. This list includes words in all languages, a fact that complicates the analysis of words 
because a word can belong to two or more languages. 

Here, we present a contribution. What [this repository in particular focuses on is in words in English only.](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies) Besides, the [list of English words provided here](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies) considers all the words that have appeared more than twenty times in the Twitter posts. For this reason, some lists contains more than ten thousand words, [see here.](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies/2020-03-24)
In summary, this repository aims to expand the one provided by [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) If you wish to cite a repository in your research, please cite the original repository of [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) because they have shared all the source code and all the data; they are the ones worthy to receive credit.
