About
============

This repository provides data extracted from [the Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). [The Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) is manteined by Dr. Juan M. Banda from the Georgia State University and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) collected all the Twitter posts containing words related to the Covid-19 pandemics and updat the information almost daily at [the Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). Their database contains more than one billion posts, and [it is freely available here.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter).

[To explore this database](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter), some knowledge of Python and its libraries is necessary. 
[The repository maintained by Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter)  presents a daily list containing the top 1000 most common words in the Twitter posts. This list includes words in all languages, a fact that complicates the analysis because a word can belong to two or more languages. 

Here, we present a contribution. What [this repository in particular presents is words in English only.](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies) Besides, the [list of English words provided here](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies) considers all the words that have appeared more than twenty times in the Twitter posts. For this reason, a list can contain more than ten thousand words, [you can check it here.](https://github.com/labcontrol-data/covid19_twitter/tree/main/dailies/2020-03-24)
In summary, this repository aims to expand the one provided by [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) If you wish to cite a repository in your research, please cite the original repository of [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) because they have shared all the source code and all the data; they are the ones worthy to receive credit.
