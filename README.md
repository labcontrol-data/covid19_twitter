About
============

This repository provides a subset of data extracted from [the Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). [The Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) is maintained by [Dr. Juan M. Banda from the Georgia State University and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) collected all the Twitter posts containing words related to the Covid-19 pandemics. This dataset is updated almost daily. Note that their database  [is freely available here.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) and contains more than one billion posts. [To explore this database](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter), some knowledge of Python and its libraries is necessary. 

[The repository maintained by Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter)  presents a daily list containing the top 1000 most common words in the Twitter posts. This list includes words in all languages, a fact that complicates the analysis because a word can belong to two or more languages. 

Here, we present a simple contribution. Instead of the top 1000 most common words in all languages, we provide here the top 2000 most common words in English only. We also present a list of negative words along with the frequency of their occurrences. This list of negative words is shown on a daily basis. The list of negative words allows us to see how the negativity has changed during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This repository looks at particular properties of the main repository provided by [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues.](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) If you wish to cite a repository in your research, please cite the original repository [Dr. Juan M. Banda and colleagues](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter). They have shared all the source code and all the Twitter data; they are the ones worthy to receive credit.
